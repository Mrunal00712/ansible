Configure == means, configure my server, it could be configuere data to setup the server anything
configuration management = 1. Manaul
                           2. Automation ( Ansible)

why we use ANsible
  ans. 1. one of the facility it provides automation
       2. Inteligence(they conguration management with intelligence)

Automation 1. Scripts= whatever i ask they do, don't use intilligence
                e.g., in redhat version 5-6 to start the service there was Service command but in redhat v7 onwards 
                      there is a systemctl comand to start the service,
                      similarly yum and dnf command
                      whatever we write they use step by step, we write script in Imperative language
                      Imperative means whatever we ask they do step by step without using mind
whathappens your company server run on different- different O.S. some on rhel9, rhel 6, ubuntu, windows etc.
if you use sheel script it will work on rhel9 but might not work on other os


Ansible use Declerative Language means whatever we want to do setup webserver ansible will do that it is something like that

          2. Ansible= whwn you want to installthe vlc player in different - differnt o.s
              you will just write the code sych that " install 'vlc'
              if you run this on rhel9 it has software installation command as dnf
              in 6 it is yum and
              in ubuntu it is apt-get
              you don't know to remenber this command ansible will internall go and install this in your o.s
              you will not equired the extra knowledge for remberming this
              this is the power og ansinle
              
Ansible is the automation tool for doing your confuguration management but the approch that ansible use is Intillagence means
we have to do declerative lang internally ansible know how to do


yum install ansible-core
ansible --version
for install any software using ansible manual(Ad-hoc command)
  # ansible package dialog install
